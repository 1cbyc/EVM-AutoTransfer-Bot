# EVM Chain Native Token Auto Transfer Bot

## Overview

The EVM Chain Native Token Transfer Bot is a Python-based bot that automates the process of sending out native tokens (e.g., BNB, MATIC, ETH) from YOUR EVM-based wallet. The primary goal of this bot is to enhance the security of crypto owners wallet by automating the transfer of illicit funds in the event of a compromise. By automating this process, the wallet owner can quickly respond to security breaches and protect their assets. Personally, I'd suggest the receiving address to be an hardware wallet (it gives a sense of protection)

## Features

- Automated transfer of native tokens upon predefined conditions.
- Monitoring of wallet address for incoming transactions.
- Customizable configuration for various EVM chain networks.
- Notification and logging mechanisms for tracking transfers.

# Contributing 

I'd appreciate contributions to this project. I made it open-source because I feel a bit rusty with my Python programming skill (it's been a while). If you have ideas for imrpovements, bug fixes, or even new features, feel free to submit pull requests. I would review it.
